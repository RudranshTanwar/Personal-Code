                    Tuberculosis treatment can be a long process. Patients go
                    through a regimen of antibiotics which lasts months,
                    fighting both the bacteria and its side effects, of which
                    some are nausea and liver damage. Drug resistent TB is also
                    a hurdle. Cutting-edge treatments hold promise, but the
                    journey remains uphill.

            <p>
                Adherence to tuberculosis treatment is critical to defeating the
                disease. Patients who miss doses risk allowing the bacteria to
                survive and develop drug resistance (World Health Organization).
                This is particularly dangerous with multidrug-resistant TB,
                which requires longer and more complex treatment (Centers for
                Disease Control and Prevention). To improve adherence,
                healthcare providers often use the Directly Observed Treatment
                Strategy (DOTS), where patients take their medication under
                supervision (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
                Diseases). However, barriers like stigma, side effects, and
                limited healthcare access make consistency difficult, especially
                in low-income areas (Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis,
                and Malaria). Educating patients and expanding community-based
                support programs are vital to ensuring treatment success and
                preventing the spread of resistant strains.

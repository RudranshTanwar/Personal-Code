                    Tuberculosis treatment can be a long process. Patients go
                    through a regimen of antibiotics which lasts months,
                    fighting both the bacteria and its side effects, of which
                    some are nausea and liver damage. Drug resistent TB is also
                    a hurdle. Cutting-edge treatments hold promise, but the
                    journey remains uphill.

                <p>
                    Although important,it is difficult to spot TB early. A skin
                    test could reveal an infection, but blood tests and chest
                    x-rays are crucial for the understanding of TB. In some
                    cases, doctors analyse the sputum for TB bacteria. Early
                    detection is often a lifesaver.

            <p>
                Diagnosing TB can be complicated, as its symptoms mimic other
                illnesses. Latent TB often goes unnoticed without specific
                tests. Advanced diagnostic methods, like molecular tests, can
                detect TB bacteria quickly and accurately. However, in
                low-resource settings, limited access to these tools makes
                diagnosis harder. Ensuring accurate results is critical to
                preventing the spread and starting effective treatment.

                <p>
                    Tuberculosis is a lung infection, which kills millions of
                    people worldwide. it is caused by the microscopic bacteria
                    <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, TB spreads through
                    droplets in the air. It is possible, and likely to carry TB
                    without knowing it. This is called latent TB. According to
                    the united nations health report,a quarter of the worlds
                    population is estimated to be carrying latent Tuberculosis.

            <p>
                Tuberculosis works by invading the lungs, where the bacteria
                Mycobacterium tuberculosis begin to multiply. The immune system
                responds by sending white blood cells to contain the infection,
                forming small clumps called granulomas. These granulomas can
                keep the bacteria inactive, leading to latent TB. However, if
                the immune system weakens, the bacteria can break out of these
                granulomas, causing active TB. This damages lung tissue and
                creates symptoms like coughing, chest pain, and fatigue. In
                severe cases, the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body
                through the bloodstream, leading to more serious complications.

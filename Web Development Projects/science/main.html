                <h2>What is Tuberculosis?</h2>
                <p>
                    Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by the bacterium
                    <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. It primarily affects
                    the lungs but can impact other parts of the body. TB can be
                    classified into two types: <strong>Latent TB</strong>, where
                    the infection is dormant, and <strong>Active TB</strong>,
                    where the disease is contagious and symptomatic. Symptoms
                    include persistent cough, fever, and weight loss.

                <h2>Impact on the Body</h2>
                <p>
                    TB primarily affects the lungs, damaging tissue and reducing
                    oxygen exchange. It can also spread to the lymph nodes,
                    bones, kidneys, and brain, causing inflammation, tissue
                    destruction, and impaired function. Specialized immune cells
                    like macrophages engulf the bacteria, and T-cells coordinate
                    the immune response.

                <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
                <p>
                    TB is diagnosed using skin tests, blood tests, chest X-rays,
                    or sputum tests. Treatment involves taking antibiotics for
                    6-9 months, with programs like Directly Observed Therapy
                    (DOT) ensuring adherence. Risks include side effects like
                    nausea or drug resistance from incomplete treatment. In
                    severe cases, surgery may be required to remove damaged
                    tissue.

                <h2>Prevention and Control</h2>
                <p>
                    Preventing TB involves vaccination with the BCG vaccine,
                    improving ventilation in crowded spaces, and avoiding close
                    contact with infected individuals. Early testing and
                    treatment for latent TB are also crucial measures to reduce
                    the risk of active disease.

                <h2>Global Context</h2>
                <p>
                    Tuberculosis is a global health issue, affecting over 10
                    million people annually and causing 1.6 million deaths.
                    Certain populations, such as those in low-income regions or
                    with weakened immune systems, are most at risk. Efforts to
                    combat TB include improving healthcare access, raising
                    awareness, and addressing socioeconomic factors contributing
                    to its spread.

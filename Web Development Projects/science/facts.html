                <p>
                    TB primarily invades the lungs. Eventually, TB can spread to
                    other organs, from bone to brain. TB can wreak havoc across
                    the body, leading to swollen lymph nodes, kidney damage, or
                    even meningitis.

                <p>
                    The symptoms of TB depend on which part of the body is affected.
                    In the lungs, it causes persistent coughing, often with blood, and chest pain. If TB spreads
                    to the spine, it can lead to back pain or paralysis.
                    TB in the kidneys might cause blood in the urine, while brain infections can trigger severe
                    headaches or confusion. Untreated, these symptoms worsen,
                    leading to long-term organ damage or death.

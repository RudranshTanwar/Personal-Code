                <p>
                    Drug reistant TB is a whole nother beast, which occurs when
                    TB becomes resistant to at least of the most effective TB
                    medicines. Abreviated as DR-TB, it is transmitted in the
                    same way as TB.It has a chance to develop when people with
                    TB quit taking meds before the disease is fully treated, or
                    when outdated drug regimens are used improperly.
